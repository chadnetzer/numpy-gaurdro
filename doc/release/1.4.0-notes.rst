=========================
NumPy 1.4.0 Release Notes
=========================

This minor includes numerous bug fixes as well as a few new features.

Highlights
==========

New features
============

New ufuncs
~~~~~~~~~~

#. copysign - return the value of the first argument with the sign copied from
   the second argument.

New iterators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new neighborhood iterator has been added to the C API. It can be used to
iterate over the items in a neighborhood of an array, and can handle boundaries
conditions automatically. Zero and one padding are available, as well as
arbitrary constant value, mirror and circular padding.

Internal changes
================

split multiarray and umath source code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The source code of multiarray and umath has been split into separate logic
units. This should make the source code more amenable for newcomers.

Separate compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, every file of multiarray (and umath) is merged into one for
compilation as was the case before, but if NPY_SEPARATE_COMPILATION env
variable is set to a non-negative value, experimental individual compilation of
each file is enabled. This makes the compile/debug cycle much faster when
working on core numpy.

Separate core math library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New functions which have been added:
	* npy_copysign
